### Project Overview

 Using Inferential statistics in Bank of NewYork to rightly expand its branches by verifying many of its statements and hypothesis.


### Learnings from the project

 Confidence Interval, Central Limit Theorem, Hypothesis Testing, Chi-Square Test. Also many more Python functions and lots of troubleshooting.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Briefly analysing the problem statement for every part of the project and relating it to the concepts that I studied before solving it, was the major part. GreyAtom study material and codes helped a lot. Google(Stack overflow, Geeks are some to list out) helped me in solving the compile time and run time errors and also gave many other options to solve the same problem. Used Jupyter Notebook to better understand the errors in the output.


### Challenges faced

 Challenges :
1) Logic building was tricky in some parts of the project. 
2) Syntax in Pandas is slightly different in updated versions due to which I had to invest more amount of time resolving the syntax errors.
Both of the above challenges were overcomed using study materials and videos from Google. I had to sometimes talk to coding experts to resolve issues related to syntax.
